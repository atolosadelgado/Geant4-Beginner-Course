# Geant4-Beginner-Course

A **Work in Progress** repository with all the materials that I developed for the Geant4 beginner course. 
Note, that I made it available only till the end of the current course (i.e. till 14 of May 2022). The reason is simply that while the 
final applciation is fully funtional, the course material and the code documentation still require some effort to be completed.
The repository will be public again when that point is reached.


The **[(very limited) documentation is avaiable here](https://geant4-beginner-course.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)**. We will use only the **[Preliminaries]https://geant4-beginner-course.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-doc/Preliminaries.html)** setion during the current course!
