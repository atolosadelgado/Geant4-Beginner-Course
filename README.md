# Geant4-Beginner-Course

A **Work in Progress** repository with all the materials that I developed for the Geant4 beginner course. 
The final applciation is fully funtional but the course material and the code documentation still require some effort to be completed.


The **[(very limited) documentation is avaiable here](https://geant4-beginner-course.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)**. We will use only its **[Preliminaries](https://geant4-beginner-course.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-doc/Preliminaries.html)** setion during the current course! The intermediate and final applications (as well as some extra codes for the preliminaries) are avaiable under the ``applications`` directory.
