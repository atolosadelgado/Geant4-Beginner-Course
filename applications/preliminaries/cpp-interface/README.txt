DESCRIPTION:
------------

A simple example for a C++ interface. An 2D shape area computation interface is 
introduced then implemented for Square and Circle. The main program demonstrates
the flexibility, i.e. runtime polimorphism, of using such C++ interfaces.

See more in the Preliminaries section of the course material.


COMPILE and EXECUTE:
--------------------

 compile: g++ -Iinclude -std=c++11 -o run main.cc
 execute: ./run
